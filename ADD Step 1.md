| Design purpose                  | This is a greenfield system in a mature domain. The purpose is to produce a sufficiently detailed design to support the construction of the system. |
| Primary functional requirements | From the previously outlined use cases, the primary ones are: <br>UC-1: Because it is a core feature of the system<br>UC-3: Because it is a core feature of the system<br>UC-4: Because it is a core feature of the system<br>UC-7: Because it is a core feature of the system<br/>UC-10: Because it is a core feature of the system<br>UC-16: Because of the technical aspect (QA-4)</br> |
| Quality Attribute Scenarios     | See Figure 1. <br>From this list, QA-2, QA-3, QA-4, QA-6 are selected as drivers.</br> |
| Constraints                     | All previously mentioned constraints are included as drivers |
| Architectural Concerns          | All previously mentioned concerns are included as drivers    |
