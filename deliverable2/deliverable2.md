| Design purpose                  | This is a greenfield system in mature domains which is a new system based on existing patterns and styles |
| Primary functional requirements |                                                              |

### Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers

The iteration goal is to establish an overall system structure

Step 3: Choose one or more elements of the System to Refine

Step 4: Choose One or More Design Concepts that Satisfy the Selected Drivers

| Design Decisions and Location                                | Rationale                                                    |

| Use the Web Applications reference architecture to structure the client part of the system | The three layers will support the system. The presentation layer can contain modules responsible for user interaction(CON-5). The data layer contains modules that handle data stored either locally or remotely (CON-6). |
